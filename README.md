# My Home Microsoft Windows Terminal Configuration

## Requirements

- Windows Terminal v1.0
  - Windows Terminal currently requires Windows OS >= 1903 (build >= 10.0.18362.0)

## Instructions

1. Clone directory into `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\git\wt`
    (where %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% usually is `C:\Users\{username}\`).
    This means that the icon images will be at the correct location for the
    values used on the settings.
2. Copy `settings.json` to Windows Terminal settings and save.
